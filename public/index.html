  Cooper Union Organization of Part-Time Faculty (CUOP)
  #

We are the voice of Cooper Union&rsquo;s adjunct, visiting, and proportional faculty, fighting for better working conditions and fair compensation since 2012. Our story is one of continuous progress in strengthening the position of part-time faculty at Cooper Union.

  Our Achievements

Meaningful salary increases that recognize the value our part-time
faculty brings to Cooper Union&rsquo;s educational excellence
A substantial $15,000 healthcare fund, addressing one of the most
pressing needs of adjunct faculty members
Investment in our members&rsquo; growth through a dedicated professional
development fund
Job security through guaranteed multi-year contracts for 15% of
adjunct faculty
A fair tier system that values and rewards years of service to the
institution
Clear and timely communication about appointments and reappointments

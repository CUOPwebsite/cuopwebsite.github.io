  #

In 2012, the Cooper Union Organization of Part-Time Faculty (CUOP) and
the Cooper Union administration agreed on an initial contract. In
2015, CUOP and Cooper Union negotiated a second contract, which was in
effect through 2017. This was extended with modifications until August
31, 2020 via a Memorandum of Agreement.
Highlights of the 2015 contract include:

Raises for part-timers
An increased health care fund ($15,000) for adjuncts
A professional development fund for adjuncts
A requirement that 15% of adjunct faculty school-wide have multi-year contracts
A tier system that ensures that adjuncts&rsquo; service years are credited
and rewarded Timely notice of appointment and reappointment

CUOP represents and negotiates on behalf of a bargaining unit
consisting of all adjunct, visiting, and proportional faculty
members. Dues or agency fees are automatically deducted from
bargaining unit members’ salaries: part-timers who prefer not to join
CUOP have agency fees deducted from their salaries. But a union is as
strong as its members, and we strongly urge you to fill out your
membership forms and authorize dues payments, not agency fees.">

<p>CUOP represents and negotiates on behalf of a bargaining unit
consisting of all adjunct, visiting, and proportional faculty
members. Dues or agency fees are automatically deducted from
bargaining unit members’ salaries: part-timers who prefer not to join
CUOP have agency fees deducted from their salaries. But a union is as
strong as its members, and we strongly urge you to fill out your
membership forms and authorize dues payments, not agency fees.</p>
<p>Union membership entitles you to vote in elections, hold union office,
have a voice in meetings and negotiations, and participate in NYSUT’s
benefits programs. You should receive a union membership form (which
includes dues authorization) when you receive your hire/re-hire letter
from Human Resources. You can also download the form. Be sure to fill
out BOTH parts of the form.</p>
<p>We are always looking for member involvement in all faculties. For
more information about CUOP and/or to get involved, contact
<a href="mailto:cooperunionparttimefaculty@gmail.com">cooperunionparttimefaculty@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>CUOP, CUFCT, and U@CU are all local affiliates of New York State
United Teachers.</p>

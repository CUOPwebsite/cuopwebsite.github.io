# CUOP

In 2012, the Cooper Union Organization of Part-Time Faculty (CUOP) and
the Cooper Union administration agreed on an initial contract. In
2015, CUOP and Cooper Union negotiated a second contract, which was in
effect through 2017. This was extended with modifications until August
31, 2020 via a Memorandum of Agreement.

Highlights of the 2015 contract include:

- Raises for part-timers
- An increased health care fund ($15,000) for adjuncts
- A professional development fund for adjuncts
- A requirement that 15% of adjunct faculty school-wide have multi-year contracts
- A tier system that ensures that adjuncts' service years are credited
  and rewarded Timely notice of appointment and reappointment

CUOP represents and negotiates on behalf of a bargaining unit
consisting of all adjunct, visiting, and proportional faculty
members. Dues or agency fees are automatically deducted from
bargaining unit members’ salaries: part-timers who prefer not to join
CUOP have agency fees deducted from their salaries. But a union is as
strong as its members, and we strongly urge you to fill out your
membership forms and authorize dues payments, not agency fees.

Union membership entitles you to vote in elections, hold union office,
have a voice in meetings and negotiations, and participate in NYSUT’s
benefits programs. You should receive a union membership form (which
includes dues authorization) when you receive your hire/re-hire letter
from Human Resources. You can also download the form. Be sure to fill
out BOTH parts of the form.

We are always looking for member involvement in all faculties. For
more information about CUOP and/or to get involved, contact

CUOP, CUFCT, and U@CU are all local affiliates of New York State
United Teachers.

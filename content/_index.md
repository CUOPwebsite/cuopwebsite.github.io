# Cooper Union Organization of Part-Time Faculty (CUOP)

We are the voice of Cooper Union's adjunct, visiting, and proportional faculty, fighting for better working conditions and fair compensation since 2012. Our story is one of continuous progress in strengthening the position of part-time faculty at Cooper Union.

## Our Achievements

Our 2015 contract, which set important precedents for part-time faculty rights, secured:

* Meaningful salary increases that recognize the value our part-time
  faculty brings to Cooper Union's educational excellence
* A substantial $15,000 healthcare fund, addressing one of the most
  pressing needs of adjunct faculty members
* Investment in our members' growth through a dedicated professional
  development fund
* Job security through guaranteed multi-year contracts for 15% of
  adjunct faculty
* A fair tier system that values and rewards years of service to the
  institution
* Clear and timely communication about appointments and reappointments

## Membership Benefits

When you join CUOP, you become part of a community dedicated to
improving higher education at Cooper Union. Membership gives you:

* A direct voice in shaping your working conditions through voting
  rights in union elections
* The opportunity to serve in union leadership positions
* Active participation in meetings and contract negotiations
* Access to valuable NYSUT programs

## Join Our Community

While all part-time faculty contribute through either dues or agency
fees, full membership empowers you to shape the future of our
workplace. New faculty members should receive a membership form with
their hire letter, but you can also download it anytime. Remember to
complete both sections of the form to activate your full membership
benefits.

## Get Involved

The strength of our union lies in active participation. Whether you
teach in art, architecture, engineering, or humanities, your voice
matters. We're always eager to welcome new members who want to
contribute to our mission.

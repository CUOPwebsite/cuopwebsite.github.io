To create a new post, create a new markdown file in
[content/posts](content/posts), it must contain a header section for
post metadata. For example:

```markdown
---
title: "About"
date: 2025-04-22T15:56:22-04:00
# bookComments: false
# bookSearchExclude: false
---

# Launch

Hi all, we're happy to launch the CUOP website today!
```

Commit and push this to the `main` branch of the repository and GitHub
will automatically deploy the changes to the live site.
